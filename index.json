There is growing evidence that language model (LM) estimates of surprisal correlate with human performance on a range of written language comprehension tasks. Although communicative interaction is perhaps the primary form of language use, most studies of surprisal employ monological, written data. Towards the goal of understanding perception in spontaneous, natural language, we present an exploratory investigation into whether the relationship between human comprehension behaviour and LM-estimated surprisal holds when applied to dialogue, considering both written dialogue, and the lexical component of spoken dialogue. We use a novel judgement task of dialogue utterance acceptability to ask two questions. \u0026ldquo;How well can people make predictions about written dialogue and transcripts of spoken dialogue?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Does surprisal correlate with these acceptability judgements?\u0026rdquo;.\nWe demonstrate that people can make accurate predictions about upcoming dialogue and that their ability differs between spoken transcripts and written conversation. We investigate the relationship between global and local operationalisations of surprisal and human acceptability judgements, finding a combination of both to provide the most predictive power.\n Stimuli:   We provide the full sets of stimuli from the Switchboard and DailyDialog corpora along with the plausibility ratings here .

Both channels shape listener expectations of upcoming communication; however, directly quantifying their relative effect on expectations is challenging. Previous attempts require spoken variations of lexically-equivalent dialogue turns or conspicuous acoustic manipulations. This paper introduces a generalised paradigm to study the value of non-lexical information in dialogue across unconstrained lexical content. By quantifying the perceptual value of the non-lexical channel with both accuracy and entropy reduction, we show that non-lexical information produces a consistent effect on expectations of upcoming dialogue: even when it leads to poorer discriminative turn judgements than lexical content alone, it yields higher consensus among participants  Stimuli:   We provide the full sets of stimuli constructed from the Switchboard corpus along with their associated ratings here .
