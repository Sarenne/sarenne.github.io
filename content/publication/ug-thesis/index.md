abstract: "Though a word may be the most intrinsic unit of language, it can be separated into 2 distinct components - form and meaning. The goal of this thesis is to explore how these 2 components are related, firstly by quantifying the form-meaning relationship itself though the use of statistical analysis, and secondly by examining potential explanations for such a relationship from a cultural evolution perspective by simulating language acquisition. The first strand of this thesis reveals that the form-meaning relationship is extremely arbitrary but more complex that reported in previous research, highlights potential flaws in previous methodologies, and provides direction for future work. The second strand of this thesis presents experimental and theoretical evidence which suggests that such arbitrariness may facilitate both language acquisition and use, thus providing partial explanation for the high degree of arbitrariness in the form-meaning relationship."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Cognitive Science BSc (Hons) thesis _[not published]_"

# People convey information extremely effectively through spoken interaction using multiple channels of information transmission - the lexical channel of *what* is said, and the non-lexical channel of *how* it is said. We propose studying human perception of spoken communication as a means to better understand how information is encoded across these channels, focusing on the question  What characteristics of communicative context affect listener's expectations of speech?.
