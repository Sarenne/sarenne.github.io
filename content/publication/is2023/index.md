abstract: 
  Speech is a fundamental means of communication that can be seen to provide two channels for   transmitting information--the lexical channel of which words are said, and the non-lexical channel of how they are spoken. Both channels shape listener expectations of upcoming communication; however, directly quantifying their relative effect on expectations is challenging. Previous attempts require spoken variations of lexically-equivalent dialogue turns or conspicuous acoustic manipulations. This paper introduces a generalised paradigm to study the value of non-lexical information in dialogue across unconstrained lexical content. By quantifying the perceptual value of the non-lexical channel with both accuracy and entropy reduction, we show that non-lexical information produces a consistent effect on expectations of upcoming dialogue--even when it leads to poorer discriminative turn judgements than lexical content alone, it yields higher consensus among participants.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "In _Interspeech 2023_; Dublin, Ireland"

# People convey information extremely effectively through spoken interaction using multiple channels of information transmission - the lexical channel of *what* is said, and the non-lexical channel of *how* it is said. We propose studying human perception of spoken communication as a means to better understand how information is encoded across these channels, focusing on the question  What characteristics of communicative context affect listener's expectations of speech?.
