abstract: 
  We present information value, a measure which quantifies the predictability of an utterance relative to a set of plausible alternatives. We introduce a method to obtain interpretable estimates of information value using neural text generators, and exploit their psychometric predictive power to investigate the dimensions of predictability that drive human comprehension behaviour. Information value is a stronger predictor of utterance acceptability in written and spoken dialogue than aggregates of token-level surprisal and it is complementary to surprisal for predicting eye-tracked reading times

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "In _EMNLP 2023_; Singapore"

# People convey information extremely effectively through spoken interaction using multiple channels of information transmission - the lexical channel of *what* is said, and the non-lexical channel of *how* it is said. We propose studying human perception of spoken communication as a means to better understand how information is encoded across these channels, focusing on the question  What characteristics of communicative context affect listener's expectations of speech?.
