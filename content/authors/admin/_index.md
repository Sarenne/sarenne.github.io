<span style="color:#6BD099"><b>Update March 2024</b> -- <i> I'm exploring opportunities to start once I've finished my PhD. Reach out to chat!</i></span>


I'm a final year PhD at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)'s [Centre for Speech Technology Research](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/) and [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), working with Catherine Lai and Peter Bell.

I'm interested in **communication** and how we use it efficiently.
My current research investigates how information encoded in the lexical and non-lexical channels of *spoken communication* affects perception, and how we can leverage these findings to build more efficient, perceptually-motivated representations of speech (and other multi-channel signals).

<i>Translation: Spoken conversation is one of the most fundamental means we have for information transmission. How can we leverage the information encoded in both [what words we say]<sub>Lexical</sub> and [how we say them]<sub>Non-lexical</sub> to better understand human communication and augment human-machine interaction?</i>

In my spare time, I play, sing, and listen to music. I enjoy climbing moutains or rocks (whichever are closer!) and teaching yoga.

{{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}}  Before starting my PhD, I worked on several ML & NLP research teams in the UK, Denmark, and Germany. Check out my {{< staticref "media/cv_phd.pdf" "newtab" >}}resum√©{{< /staticref >}} for more details.
